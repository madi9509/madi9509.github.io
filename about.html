            After spending almost 20 years in Corporate America immersed in Fortune 1000 organizations, and the past
            decade as a high-ranking executive in public and privately-held companies, Shelly Tygielski turned to
            teaching “modern-life mindfulness” full-time, with a special emphasis on the business sector and athletic
            organizations. In 2016, Shelly launched “America Meditates,” a grass-roots organization bringing 90- minute
            workshops to cities across America.</p>
